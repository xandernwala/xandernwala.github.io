I am an Assistant Professor of [Data Science](https://www.wm.edu/as/data-science/index.php) at William and Mary (W&M). Before joining W&M, I was a postdoc at the [Observatory on Social Media](https://osome.iu.edu/), Indiana University, Bloomington. And before that, a member of the [Web Science and Digital Libraries](https://oduwsdl.github.io/) (WS-DL) Research Group at Old Dominion University (ODU). I'm a Computer Science graduate of ODU (PhD: 2020, MS: 2014) and Elizabeth City State University (BS: 2011).
