I am a Professor of Computer Science at Old Dominion University, where I've been on faculty since 2006.  I'm a graduate of UNC-Chapel Hill (PhD 2003, MS 1998) and Northeast Louisiana University (BS 1996).  I'm currently featured on the [ODU Faculty Women in STEM page](https://www.odu.edu/facultydevelopment/women-in-stem#tab9=3&done1612907281342), where you can read a bit about my background and experiences as a woman in computer science.

**Research Interests:** web science, social media, web archiving, digital preservation, information visualization (see some student infovis projects at my [infovis gallery](https://www.cs.odu.edu/~mweigle/research/gallery.html))

For an overview of what I've been working on the past few years, see [On the importance of web archiving](https://items.ssrc.org/parameters/on-the-importance-of-web-archiving/), an article I wrote for [*SSRC Parameters*](https://items.ssrc.org/category/parameters/) in 2018.
