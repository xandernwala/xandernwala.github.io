excerpt: "I join the chorus to say 2020 was a year like no other, and shaped by three historic events: the *Coronavirus pandemic*, the *protests surrounding the Black Lives Matter* movement, and the *US Presidential elections*. According to [StoryGraph](http://storygraph.cs.odu.edu/), in 2018, the top news story was the [Kavanaugh hearings](http://storygraph.cs.odu.edu/graphs/polar-media-consensus-graph/#cursor=116&hist=1440&t=2018-09-27T19:24:01). In 2019, it was the [Mueller Report](http://storygraph.cs.odu.edu/graphs/polar-media-consensus-graph/#cursor=135&hist=1440&t=2019-03-24T22:32:21). Similar to [2018](https://ws-dl.blogspot.com/2019/03/2019-03-05-365-dots-in-2018-top-news.html) and [2019](https://ws-dl.blogspot.com/2020/01/2020-01-04-365-dots-in-2019-top-news.html), we analyzed all news stories collected by StoryGraph at 10-minute intervals every day in 2020, to identify the top news stories of 2020. Recall how we identify top news stories, explained briefly in [365 dots in 2019](https://ws-dl.blogspot.com/2020/01/2020-01-04-365-dots-in-2019-top-news.html) and in detail by the [tech report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.09989), and repeated here for convenience."
