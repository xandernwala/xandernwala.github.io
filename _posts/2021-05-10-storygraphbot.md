excerpt: "I join the chorus to say 2020 was a year like no other, and shaped by three historic events: the *Coronavirus pandemic*, the *protests surrounding the Black Lives Matter* movement, and the *US Presidential elections*. According to [StoryGraph](http://storygraph.cs.odu.edu/), in 2018, the top news story was the Kavanaugh hearings. In 2019, it was the Mueller Report. Similar to 2018 and 2019, we analyzed all news stories collected by StoryGraph at 10-minute intervals every day in 2020, to identify the top news stories of 2020. Recall how we identify top news stories, explained briefly in 365 dots in 2019 and in detail by the tech report, and repeated here for convenience."
